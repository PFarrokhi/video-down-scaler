# video-scaler
This video scaler combines "Nearest Neighbor" and "Linear" algorithms to reach the advantages of both algorithms. On one hand, the "Nearest Neighbor" is too simple; This is an algorithm with almost no processing overhead but with bad quility. on the other hand, the "Linear" algorithm has pretty good and enough quality. However, it includes multiplication and devision which has high overhead in many hardwares. Therefore, I implemented an algorithm between them that has both high quality and high speed. It works with the clocking rate of 350MHz and the throughput of 1 pixel which means 350 million pixels per second.
